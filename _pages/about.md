<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Currently, I am a postdoctoral researcher at Peking University, where I also completed my Ph.D. in 2024 under the supervision of [Prof. Huaiqiu Zhu](https://cqb.pku.edu.cn/cqben/info/1002/1747.htm). I obtained my bachelor's degree in 2019 under the supervision of [Prof. Chaoyu He](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Chaoyu-He-2).

My research lies at the intersection of Computational Biology and Artificial Intelligence, with a particular focus on applying AI to solve challenging problems in Bioinformatics. Specifically, my work involves leveraging machine learning techniques for tasks such as novel virus discovery and virus-host prediction. I aim to develop computational tools that can accelerate biological research and provide new insights into complex biological systems.

I welcome the opportunity to listen to others and exchange ideas. Please feel free to drop me an email if you would like to discuss anything with me! I am always open to collaboration.
